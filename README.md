Automatic recognition of fake Indian currency is very
important in major domains like banking nowadays. This
system is used to detect whether the currency is fake or
original through the automated system which is through
convolution neural network, in deep learning. Deep learning
excels in the task of recognition and classification of images
over a large data sets, which is also primarily used in object
category recognition. In the recent demonetization drive may
be a step towards eradication of corruption and black money,
but it fails to address the problem of counterfeit currency. A
deep neural network is a computational model
that works in a similar fashion to the neurons in the human
brain. Each neuron takes an input, per- forms some
operations then passes its output to the following neuron that
is to its hidden layer.
